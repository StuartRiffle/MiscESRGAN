## Misc ESRGAN filters

Many of these are obsolete or have better versions available now (like Nickelback). This is an old collection. But if you want to pick through it, enjoy!

If you're using a Stable Diffusion web UI (like [Automatic1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git)), you can use these files by putting them in the `models\\ESRGAN` folder and restarting the UI. They will all appear in the _Extras_ tab. For better or worse.
